***Testing display method***
bag1 is 
There are 5 element(s): B C A B A 
bag2 is 
There are 0 element(s): 
After removing the first element B from bag1, it contains
There are 4 element(s): C A B A 

***Testing equals method***
Are bag1 and bag2 equal? --> NO
Are bag2 and bag1 equal? --> NO
bag2:
There are 5 element(s): X B A C A 
Are bag1 and bag2 equal? --> NO
Removed X from bag2.
There are 4 element(s): B A C A 
Are bag1 and bag2 equal now? --> NO
Created bagCopyOfBag1:
There are 4 element(s): C A B A 
Are bag1 and bagCopyOfBag1 equal? --> YES

***Testing smallest method***
bag1: There are 7 element(s): A C A X B A A 
bag2: There are 7 element(s): D C C A B B A 
The smallest item in bag1 is: A
The smallest item in bag2 is: A

***Testing union, removeMax, intersection, difference and subset methods***
bag1: There are 7 element(s): A C A X B A A 
bag2: There are 7 element(s): D C C A B B A 

***Testing union method***
The union of bag1 and bag2 is 
There are 14 element(s): A B B A C C D A A B X A C A 

***Testing removeMax method***
Removed the largest element "X" from the union bag; the current content is:
There are 13 element(s): B B A C C D A A B A A C A 
Bag is empty
The bag is empty and removeMax returned null - CORRECT

***Testing intersection method***
The intersection of bag1 and bag2 is 
There are 4 element(s): B A C A 

***Testing difference method***
The difference of bag1 and bag2 is 
There are 3 element(s): X A A 
The difference of bag2 and bag1 is 
There are 3 element(s): B C D 

***Testing subset method***
Is bag1 a subset of bag1 ? --> YES
Is bag1 a subset of bag2 ? --> NO
Bag is empty
Is an empty bag a subset of bag2 ? --> YES
Is bag2 a subset of an empty bag ? --> NO
Created bag3:
There are 3 element(s): C B A 
Created bag4:
There are 3 element(s): A C B 
Is bag3 a subset of bag4 ? --> YES
Is bag3 a subset of bag4 after adding "Z" to it ? --> YES
Is bag4 a subset of bag3 ? --> NO
Adding  "Z" to bag3 twice
Bag3 is:
There are 5 element(s): Z Z C B A 
Bag4 is:
There are 4 element(s): Z A C B 
Is bag3 a subset of bag4 ? --> NO

***Testing replace method***
Bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): A C A X B A A 
Replacing an element with "X"
Now bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): X C A X B A A 

***Testing removeEvery method***
Bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): X C A X B A A 
Removing all "Z"
After removing all "Z" bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): X C A X B A A 
Removing all "X"
After removing all "X" bag1 contains:
There are 5 element(s): C A B A A 
After adding two "A" bag1 contains:
There are 7 element(s): A A C A B A A 
Removing all "A"
After removing all "A" bag1 contains:
There are 2 element(s): C B 
Removing all "B"
After removing all "B" bag1 contains:
There are 1 element(s): C
